## Features

- Multiple game modes, including:
  - Addition practice
  - Subtraction practice
  - Multiplication practice
  - Mixed mode (randomized math problems)
- Tracks the user's progress while playing.
- Designed to be beginner-friendly and intuitive.

## How to Run

### Running in GitHub CodeSpaces:
1. Open the repository in [GitHub CodeSpaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
2. Navigate to the **maths_game** folder.
3. Execute the program by running:
   ```bash
   python mathsgame.py
   ```

### Running Locally:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CeamanCollins/my_work.git
   cd my_work/maths_game
   ```
2. Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python mathsgame.py
   ```
   On Windows:
   ```bash
   [path-to-python]\python.exe mathsgame.py
   ```

## Requirements

This script requires **no external dependencies** and relies entirely on Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for the game.
- **GitHub CodeSpaces**: Provides a cloud-based development environment for running and testing the script.
- **Standard Library**: Utilized modules like `random` for generating math problems dynamically.

## Future Enhancements

Potential ideas for improving the Maths Game:
- Adding a timer to create a speed challenge mode.
- Incorporating scoring and leaderboards.
- Adding more advanced math topics (e.g., division, decimals, fractions).
- Creating a GUI-based version using PyQt or Tkinter.
