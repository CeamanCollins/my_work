## Contents

### 1. [Maths Game](./maths_game/)
- A simple mathematics game with various modes designed to help users practice basic math skills.
- **How to Run**:  
  - In CodeSpaces or VSCode, or via the command line:
    ```bash
    python mathsgame.py
    ```
    On Windows:
    ```bash
    [path-to-python]\python.exe mathsgame.py
    ```
- **Requirements**: No external packages are required; the script uses only Python's standard library.

### 2. [Electricity Rates Project](./electricity_rates/)
- Several notebooks analyze 2024 electricity usage data for multiple addresses and compare it to various tariffs to determine the best option. The project includes visualizations of electricity consumption and feed-ins for better decision-making.
- **How to Run**:  
  - View the notebooks on GitHub or execute them in CodeSpaces, VSCode, or a local Jupyter Notebook server.
- **Requirements**: Dependencies can be installed as follows:
  - **Using Pip**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  - **Using Conda**:
    ```bash
    conda create --name <environment-name> --file requirements.txt
    ```

### 3. [Electricity Rates Project](./electricity_rates_2026/)
- Two notebooks analyze 2024-2025 electricity usage data for two addresses and compare it against various tariffs including microgeneration calculations, standing fees and bonuses, to determine the best option for the coming year.
- **How to Run**:  
  - View the notebooks on GitHub or execute them in CodeSpaces, VSCode, or a local Jupyter Notebook server.
- **Requirements**: Dependencies can be installed as follows:
  - **Using Pip**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  - **Using Conda**:
    ```bash
    conda create --name <environment-name> --file requirements.txt
    ```

### 4. [Card Draw](./card_draw/)
- A script that uses an API to draw 5 cards from a virtual deck and congratulates the user if a special poker hand is drawn (e.g., pairs, triples, straights, flushes, etc.).
- **How to Run**:  
  - In CodeSpaces or VSCode, or via the command line:
    ```bash
    python carddraw.py
    ```
    On Windows:
    ```bash
    [path-to-python]\python.exe carddraw.py
    ```
- **Requirements**: No external packages are required; the script uses only Python's standard library.

## How to Get Started

1. **Choose a Project**: Navigate to one of the project folders ([`maths_game`](./maths_game/), [`electricity_rates`](./electricity_rates/), or [`card_draw`](./card_draw/)) to explore the specifics.
2. **Run the Code**: Follow the setup and execution instructions for each project to run them in your local or cloud-based Python environment.
3. **Install Dependencies**: For projects requiring dependencies, use `pip` or `conda` as described above.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for all projects.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Utilized in the Electricity Rates Project for data analysis and visualization.
- **APIs**: The Card Draw project makes use of the [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) to simulate card drawing.
- **GitHub CodeSpaces**: Enables running and testing code directly in the cloud.
